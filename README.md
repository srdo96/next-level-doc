#### Contribution Guidelines

Please follow these steps to ensure consistency and quality across contributions.

### Adding New Notes

1. Go to the `docs/` folder.
2. If you're adding notes for a new module:
   - Check if a markdown file already exists (e.g., `module2.md`).
   - If it **does not exist**, create a new file following the structure of `module1.md`.
   - If it **does exist**, add your notes to that file in proper markdown format.
3. Keep headings, bullet points, and code blocks consistent with the existing style.

### General Rules

- Follow the project’s code and markdown style guidelines.
- Write clear, concise commit messages describing your changes.
- Ensure your content is accurate, formatted, and free of spelling errors.
- Do not remove or overwrite others’ contributions—add yours in context.
- Before submitting a Pull Request, make sure your branch is up to date with `main`.

### Communication

- Open an **Issue** if you have questions, suggestions, or spot a bug.
- Be respectful and collaborative—this is a community project.
- Provide enough context when proposing changes or new ideas.
